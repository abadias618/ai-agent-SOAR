 This isn't happening, it really isn't.  You were just about to finish up a two week probationary period as a site operator at the University computer center on the third floor of Hodges Hall.  It was a quiet night, you were working on that interactive fiction game, nobody around...and then you saw a shadow out of the corner of your eye.  And one of the laser printers is gone.  Unless it's back before 7am, this job - the one you were counting on to pay your tuition next semester - is, shall we say, history.  You sigh.  It's not going to be just another...

Computer Site

This is the computer site.  You know, half a dozen PCs, couple of Macs, a printer table, the desk at which you write that interactive fiction game instead of study.  An internet router hums quietly in the corner.

The door is northeast.

Gnome's Lair
You are in a small room, lit only by a bare 40-watt light bulb hanging from the ceiling.  The floor is littered with paper listings and several copies of "Spelunker Today."  On a table you see a very disreputable-looking IBM PC clone... and the missing Owlet-Picker V printer!

In a corner, there's a boombox playing the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, by J.S. Bach.
